# N-Queen-Visualizer

The N-Queen-Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize the N-Queen problem, a classic combinatorial problem in which N queens
must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

# Features->

Interactive Visualization: Watch as the algorithm solves the N-Queen problem step-by-step.
Multiple Algorithms: Choose from different algorithms (e.g., backtracking, genetic algorithms) to see how each one approaches the problem.
Customizable Board Size: Set the value of N to see how the problem scales with larger boards.
Real-time Feedback: See the position of queens on the board and understand why certain moves are made or rejected.
Performance Metrics: Track the time taken and the number of iterations to solve the problem.
